= Color customization

Color customization can be performed by editing htlm in respective partials (.hbs files usually located in the "ui-bundle\partials" folder path.)

A reference of more customizations can be found here: https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_styles.asp

An example of a line added to the "article.hbs" file:

[source,html]
----
<article class="doc">
    <body style="color:gray;background-color:powderblue;"> <!--1-->
{{#with page.title}}
<h1 class="page">{{{this}}}</h1>
{{/with}}
{{{page.contents}}}
{{> pagination}}
</article>

----
<1> On this line a custom color has been assigned to the article class, and is why this appears in a webrowser with a non-standard background color.
